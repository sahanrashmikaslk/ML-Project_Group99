# Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight delays in the United States domestic air traffic system using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics for the year 2020, we aim to develop a predictive model that can anticipate flight delays with high accuracy.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/sahanrashmikaslk/ML-Project_Group99`

2. Install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process.

4. Run the source code files in the `src` directory to train the machine learning model and make predictions.

## Results

Our preliminary results indicate promising performance in predicting flight delays using the selected machine learning model. For detailed analysis and visualizations, refer to the notebooks and results directory.
